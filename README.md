# Grapple

Grapple is a 2D side scrolling game in which you play as a penguin with dreams of flying. Unfortunately, because he is overweight,
he must instead rely on his grappling hook to latch onto clouds and soar.

The game is currently on the app store, go check it out here: [iTunes Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grapple!/id1141115019?mt=8)

Note: The app store version is still buggy, so keep a look out for updates!

###TODOS
1. Make a better tutorial
2. Add ingame currency and shop

###BUGS
1. Grappling hook sprite occasionally shakes when penguin is swinging from it
2. If the hook is still being shot when the penguin dies, the hook sprite doesn't disappear
